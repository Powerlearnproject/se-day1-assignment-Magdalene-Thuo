#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the aproach of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It is important as it ensures software meet quality standards, reliability and scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968): The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This milestone recognized the growing complexity of software development and the need for structured methodologies.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s):Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, leading to more modular and reusable code.

The Agile Manifesto (2001): The Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress over rigid planning.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Identifying project goals, requirements, and feasibility.

1. Idea generation -look at a problem to solve
2. Requirement analysis– Gathering and defining requirements.
3. Product Design – Creating architecture and system models.
4. Product development-Writing and coding the software.
5. Intergration and Testing – Identifying and fixing defects.
6. Deployment – Releasing the software for use.
7. Maintenance – Updating and improving the system over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall have low flexibility while agile have high flexibility. Waterfall is linearor sequential while agile is iterative and flexible.
Waterfall: Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, such as medical or financial software.

Agile: Best for projects requiring frequent updates, such as mobile app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and debugs issues.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards through testing.

Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, resource allocation, and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Provide code editing, debugging, and testing tools in one platform.

Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

Version Control Systems (VCS)

Track code changes and facilitate collaboration.

Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complex Codebases – Use modular programming and documentation.

Debugging and Troubleshooting – Implement logging and automated testing.

Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes – Continuous learning and professional development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components for correctness.
2. Integration Testing – Ensures combined components work together.
3. System Testing – Evaluates the complete system’s functionality.
4. Acceptance Testing – Validates the system meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to optimize interactions with AI models.It helps in generating precise, relevant, and high-quality AI responses, improving user experience and efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt: "Explain artificial intelligence, including its key applications in healthcare, finance, and transportation. Provide examples."
Specificity: Defines the scope (AI applications).

Clarity: Provides context (industries: healthcare, finance, transportation).

Conciseness: Makes it easier for the AI to generate a focused response.
